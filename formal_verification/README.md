# Formal Verification Framework

A comprehensive formal verification system that integrates with DSPy agents to provide mathematical certainty in cognitive dissonance resolution. This framework moves beyond probabilistic "best guess" reconciliation to achieve mathematical proof where possible.

## Core Philosophy

**"Stop arguing; prove it."**

When agents disagree about verifiable claims, we don't debate—we prove. Mathematical truth provides definitive resolution with confidence=1.0, while subjective claims gracefully fall back to probabilistic methods.

## Architecture

### Core Components

```
DSPy Agents → Mathematical Resolver → Formal Verification → Necessity Prover → Z3/Coq

## Mathematical Necessity

The breakthrough innovation is **necessity-based proof discovery**—deriving proofs from mathematical structure rather than brute-force tactics.

### Supported Mathematical Patterns

#### Arithmetic (Deductive Necessity)
```python
"2 + 2 = 4"      → PROVEN (arithmetic computation)
"7 - 3 = 4"      → PROVEN (subtraction necessity)  
"5 * 6 = 30"     → PROVEN (multiplication necessity)
"2 + 2 = 5"      → DISPROVEN (counter-example: 2 + 2 = 4 ≠ 5)
```

#### Mathematical Functions (Inductive Necessity)
```python
"factorial(5) = 120"    → PROVEN (inductive definition)
"fibonacci(7) = 13"     → PROVEN (recurrence relation)
"gcd(12, 8) = 4"       → PROVEN (Euclidean algorithm)
"sum(1 to 10) = 55"    → PROVEN (closed-form formula)
```

#### Inequalities (Deductive Necessity)
```python
"5 < 10"        → PROVEN (natural number ordering)
"15 >= 10"      → PROVEN (comparison necessity)
"10 < 5"        → DISPROVEN (ordering contradiction)
```

#### Mathematical Identities (Definitional Necessity)
```python
"n + 0 = n"              → PROVEN (additive identity axiom)
"x * 1 = x"              → PROVEN (multiplicative identity)
"forall n, n + 0 = n"    → PROVEN (universal identity)
```

## Proof Discovery Process

### 1. Necessity Analysis
```python
from formal_verification.necessity_prover import MathematicalStructureAnalyzer

analyzer = MathematicalStructureAnalyzer()
evidence = analyzer.analyze_claim("factorial(4) = 24")

# Returns: NecessityEvidence(
#   necessity_type=INDUCTIVE,
#   confidence=1.0,
#   proof_sketch="Theorem: factorial(4) = 24. Proof: By induction on factorial definition."
# )
```

### 2. Proof Construction
```python
from formal_verification.necessity_prover import NecessityBasedProver

prover = NecessityBasedProver()
result = prover.prove_by_necessity(claim)

# Returns: ProofResult(proven=True, proof_time_ms=150.0, ...)
```

### 3. Hybrid Fallback
For claims without necessity patterns, the system falls back to Z3/Coq hybrid proving:

```python
from formal_verification.detector import FormalVerificationConflictDetector

detector = FormalVerificationConflictDetector(
    use_hybrid=True,           # Z3 + Coq
    enable_necessity=True,     # Necessity-first
    enable_auto_repair=True    # Automated lemma discovery
)
```

## Advanced Capabilities

### Proof Strategy Learning
ML-driven analysis learns optimal proving strategies:

```python
# 13-dimensional feature analysis
features = ProofFeatures(
    claim_length=15,
    mathematical_operators=2,
    logical_operators=0,
    quantifier_depth=1,
    # ... 9 more dimensions
)

strategy = learner.predict_optimal_strategy(claim)
# Returns: recommended prover, confidence, rationale
```

### Automated Lemma Discovery
When proofs fail, the system analyzes error patterns and synthesizes helper lemmas:

```python
# Analyzes 6 failure modes:
# - INDUCTION_NEEDED
# - UNIFICATION_FAILED  
# - TACTIC_FAILED
# - TYPE_ERROR
# - UNDEFINED_REFERENCE
# - TIMEOUT

suggested_lemmas = engine.discover_supporting_lemmas(failed_result)
repaired_proof = repairer.repair_failed_proof(result, spec)
```

### Deep Program Analysis
Extracts complex software properties for verification:

```python
properties = analyzer.analyze_program(code, language="python")

# Discovers 8 property categories:
# - MEMORY_SAFETY: "No buffer overflows"
# - CONCURRENCY: "Race condition free"  
# - ALGORITHMIC: "Sorting correctness"
# - TERMINATION: "Always terminates"
# - PERFORMANCE: "O(n log n) complexity"
# - SECURITY: "Input validation"
# - CORRECTNESS: "Functional specification"
# - INVARIANT: "Loop invariants hold"
```

## Performance

## Usage Examples

### Basic Mathematical Resolution
```python
from cognitive_dissonance.mathematical_resolver import MathematicalCognitiveDissonanceResolver

resolver = MathematicalCognitiveDissonanceResolver(enable_formal_verification=True)

result = resolver(
    text1="The sum of 2 plus 2 equals 4. This is basic arithmetic.",
    text2="Actually, 2 + 2 = 5. Mathematical addition works differently."
)

print(f"Resolution Method: {result.resolution_method}")  # "mathematical_proof"
print(f"Final Confidence: {result.final_confidence}")    # 1.0
print(f"Resolved Claim: {result.resolved_claim}")        # "2 + 2 = 4"
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Mathematical resolution demonstration
python -m cognitive_dissonance.main mathematical

# Advanced experiment with formal verification  
python -m cognitive_dissonance.main advanced --optimization gepa --rounds 1
```

### Direct Formal Verification
```python
from formal_verification import FormalVerificationConflictDetector, Claim, PropertyType
import time

detector = FormalVerificationConflictDetector()

claim = Claim(
    agent_id="mathematician",
    claim_text="factorial(6) = 720", 
    property_type=PropertyType.CORRECTNESS,
    confidence=0.95,
    timestamp=time.time()
)

results = detector.analyze_claims([claim])
print(f"Proven: {results['proof_results'][0].proven}")    # True
print(f"Proof time: {results['proof_results'][0].proof_time_ms}ms")  # ~150ms
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Necessity-Based Proving?
Traditional theorem provers try various tactics until something works. Our necessity analyzer determines what *must* be true from mathematical structure, then constructs targeted proofs. This is fundamentally more efficient and reliable.

### Why Hybrid Z3/Coq?
- **Z3**: Excellent for constraint solving, arithmetic, arrays, satisfiability
- **Coq**: Superior for inductive proofs, complex theorems, type theory
- **Hybrid**: Intelligent selection based on claim characteristics

### Why Integrate with DSPy?
DSPy agents handle natural language understanding and conflict detection. Formal verification provides mathematical certainty for the subset of claims that can be proven. This combines the best of both worlds.

## Future Directions

- **Expanded necessity patterns**: Support for calculus, linear algebra, set theory
- **Interactive proof assistant**: User-guided proof construction  
- **Proof explanation**: Natural language explanations of formal proofs
- **Advanced software verification**: Full program verification workflows
- **Integration with external provers**: Lean, Isabelle/HOL, Agda support
