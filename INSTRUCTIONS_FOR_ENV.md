To use the updated `main.py` and avoid hardcoding sensitive information, please follow these steps:

1.  **Rename `.env.example` to `.env`**:
    ```bash
    mv /home/developer/projects/cognitive-dissonance-dspy/.env.example /home/developer/projects/cognitive-dissonance-dspy/.env
    ```

2.  **Edit `.env`**: Open the `.env` file and ensure the `OLLAMA_API_BASE` and `WIKI1K_URL` values are correct for your environment.

3.  **Install `python-dotenv`**: This library helps load environment variables from a `.env` file.
    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv
    ```

4.  **Modify `main.py` to load `.env`**: Add the following lines at the very top of `main.py` (before any other imports):
    ```python
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    load_dotenv()
    ```

5.  **Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`**: This prevents your `.env` file (which contains sensitive information) from being committed to Git. It should already be there for most Python projects, but it's good to double-check.

After these steps, your `main.py` will load the `OLLAMA_API_BASE` and `WIKI1K_URL` from your `.env` file, keeping them out of your version control.

Now that the immediate security concern is addressed, we can proceed with bringing the `cognitive-dissonance-dspy` repository up to the "production level" of `folie-a-deux-dspy`.
